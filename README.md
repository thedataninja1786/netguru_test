# System Design: SME-Guided Customer Support Classification

## 1. INPUT CHANNELS INGESTION 
### Utilize APIs or other connectors to gather incoming requests
-   Integration Protocols:
    - Email: IMAP/SMTP with OAuth authentication
    - Live Chat: WebSocket/REST API integration
-   Normalize data into a common format, such as JSON, with fields like:
    - Channel: Email/Live chat
    - Message content: The text body of the message
    - Customer details: Name, email, customer ID, order ID


## 2. DATA PROCESSING 
Utilize SME expertise to map customer queries to request categories.
Clean and normalize the data by applying lowercase conversion, stopword removal, and lemmatization to unify variations of the same word.
Finally the clean data should be tokenized for mapping and rule-matching with the corresponding customer support team.
Create detailed categorization of issue types with the following sample mapping structure.

    SUPPORT_CATEGORIES = {
        "order_tracking": {
        "keywords": ["track", "shipping", "delivery", "order status"],
        "priority": 2,
        "team": "logistics"
        },
        "payment_errors": {
        "keywords": ["payment", "charge", "declined", "refund"],
        "priority": 3,
        "team": "finance"
        },
        # Additional categories...
    }
    
## 3. RULE-BASED CLASSIFIER
### SME-defined rules to map requests to the corresponding support team
Implement a rule-based classifier that assigns the incoming (processed) query to a category.
Enhance classification robustness by using word embeddings to identify keywords semantically similar to the query.
The classifier can take a tuple of (embedding,query) -> prediction. This approach ensures O(1) runtime complexity on inference, enabling high processing efficiency. 
When the dataset grows large enough, convert to an ensemble of models, combining a stochastic (ML) and deterministic approach, and vote on the predictions.

## 4. SME FEEDBACK LOOP
A fedback loop mechanism for tracking missclassifications and edge cases, providing continous improvment of the framework.
The SMEs review flagged messages and adjust the rules accordingly.

## 5-6. JIRA TICKET GENERATION AND INTEGRATION
Generate tickets using predefined templates with dynamic fields populated by customer-specific data. Assign priority and support team based on classification. 
Integrate with support systems like Jira via REST API to ensure tickets contain all necessary information for resolution.

    {
        "template": "order_tracking",
        "fields": {
            "customer_name": "Jon Doe",
            "order_id": "123456",
            "issue_description": "Customer wants to track their order status."
        },
        "priority": 2,
        "team": "logistics"
    }
